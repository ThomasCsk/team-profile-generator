## Description

This project is meant to make it easier for someone to make and keep track of a team of developers. This project was by far the hardest one I have worked on so far. The concept of Object Oriented Development makes complete sense to me, but Test Driven Development is something that was tiresome and took some time getting used to. Once I got past figuring out how to make and test my constructors, I got stuck on how to make each individual piece of this application work together. In the end, I didn't find a perfect solution, but I found a solution that works.

## Installation
  
To install this project, you can either clone the repository or download the zip file.
  
## Usage
  
To use this project, you first need to clone or install the project. Once that is done, open the project in VS Code and open an integrated terminal in the root of the project. In the terminal, type npm install. This will install the required node packages for this project. Then, type node index into the terminal. This will start the question prompts. Once you finish the question prompts, your website should generate automatically, so navigate through the project to the /dist folder and open the index.html file. This will be your website containing your newly made team.

If you're still a bit confused on how to work this project, here is a walkthrough video on exactly how to work it:

## Testing

To run the tests on this project, you can just run the npm test command in the integrated terminal
  
## Credits

I only used one third party node package in this project, but it played such a big role, I though I should include it here:

Inquirer Node Package: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
